`R-Ladies Global` is an inspiring community, full of empowerment, and diversity in the field of data science. Founded in 2012 by `Gabriela de Queiroz`, R-Ladies began as a grassroots movement with a simple mission: `to promote gender diversity in the R programming community` and provide `a welcoming space for women and gender minorities` to learn, collaborate, and excel in data science.

- `R-Ladies` is now a **world-wide organization** with `219 chapters` in `63 countries`, more than `4000 events` and about `93,000 members` globally.

# Case Studies

Let's explore some real-world examples of effective talk customization for diverse audiences.

## Case 1: Data Science Workshop

About 10% of the event titles mention the words: `workshop|course|tutorial|introduction|introducci√≥n`

-   Audience: A mix of beginners and experienced data scientists.
-   Customization: Started with foundational concepts for beginners and delved into advanced techniques for experts.



## Case 2: RLadies Meeting

Only less than 1% of the event titles mention the word `career`, while 2.5% is dedicated to `visualization`.

-   Audience: Members from various backgrounds.
-   Customization: Varied the topics discussed to cater to the interests of different members.
